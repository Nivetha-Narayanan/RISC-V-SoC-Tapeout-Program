### üöÄ Program Introduction

This project is a complete, hands-on journey to design, implement, and fabricate a **RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)** using **Synopsys EDA tools** and the **SCL180 PDK**. It's crafted for students, educators, and professionals aiming to master end-to-end chip development‚Äîfrom RTL design to post-silicon validation.

As part of India‚Äôs **Semiconductor Mission**, this program focuses on building a proven, reusable methodology‚Äîfrom design to silicon‚Äîthat academic institutions can adopt. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work, documenting my progress through the initial online training phase.
