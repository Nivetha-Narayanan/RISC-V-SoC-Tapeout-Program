# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program
A portfolio documenting the end-to-end design, implementation, and fabrication journey of a RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC) as part of a national-level initiative using Synopsys EDA tools and the SCL180 PDK.

#### **Program Vision:** A national-level initiative to empower engineering students with the most authentic VLSI experience‚Äîfrom RTL design to actual silicon fabrication (tapeout).

# **üöÄ Program Introduction**

This project is a complete, hands-on journey to design, implement, and fabricate a **RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)** using **Synopsys EDA tools** and the **SCL180 PDK**. It's crafted for students, educators, and professionals aiming to master end-to-end chip development‚Äîfrom RTL design to post-silicon validation.

As part of India‚Äôs Semiconductor Mission, this program focuses on building a proven, reusable methodology‚Äîfrom design to silicon‚Äîthat academic institutions can adopt. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work, documenting my progress through the initial online training phase.
