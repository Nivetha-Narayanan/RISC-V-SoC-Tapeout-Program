Introsuction to dot lib 
  1.unstanding standard library name  "sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib"
    -PVT--> is process,Voltage,Temperature
    -tt means typical process -variations due to fabrication
    -025C means temoerature
    -1v80 means voltage
    -all these together based that the silicon to be works
 2.sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib" tells
  -technology(Cmos)
  -delay lookup table
  -contains all cells with different flavors
  -tells each cells leakage power,area and delay for all input combination of  cell
let we use for and gate  with different flavor of and2_0 ,and2_2,and2_4 cell:
  (imag)
-we interrept that area incraeses even though they are samw logic cell and 2,
   -wider cell -large area,delay less,consume high power
   -smaller cell-less area,delay high,consume less power

what is heirachical synthesis and flat synthesis?
 one multiplr_modules(contains sub modules)-sub modules are instantiated in the top module verolog code
#multiple_module.v 
e.g:module sub_module2 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a | b;
endmodule

module sub_module1 (input a, input b, output y);
	assign y = a&b;
endmodule


module multiple_modules (input a, input b, input c , output y);
	wire net1;
	sub_module1 u1(.a(a),.b(b),.y(net1));  //net1 = a&b
	sub_module2 u2(.a(net1),.b(c),.y(y));  //y = net1|c ,ie y = a&b + c;
endmodule
in hierarchical it creates the sub module 1 has or cell and 2 has and gate ,it connects the submodules.
in flatten ,it gives entire connection rather than each module connection
Why we need submodule besd syth?
 since when we used same module multiple times in one design,by using the submodule syth used multiple times rather than sythesis multiple times..
here is the screenshot both synthesis

Why we need flop in circuit?
   -in digital design,ther is hazard cindition that is momentary change in the output when there no need of change
   -while cascading  these hazard design,create glicthes in output
   -to avoid this one ,we inserted the flipflop using clock no glithes in output
    -we need to intialize the flop using synchrouns and asynchrouns set and reset,otherwise the circuit gives garpage value
Dff coding styles
 -Let see the each sytles individaully
 gvim -c "vsplit dff_asyncres_syncres.v | split dff_asyncres.v | vsplit dff_async_set.v"  dff_syncres.v
these are the four style files
flop simulations :

their gtkwave screenshots are:

```in yosys
read_liberty -lib ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
read_verilog dff_asyncres.v
synth -top dff_asyncres
dfflibmap -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
abc -liberty ../lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
show```
similar other two styles
all styles show screenshots are:

Optimisation:
let us cinsider the num multiplied by 2
is we really need hardware?
  No.since appeding one zero in last then we get answer
here is synthesized netlist and logic circuit:

Special case:
for a number multiplied by 9 that is eqaul to num*(8+1)=num*8+num;
num*8-->appending three zeros
+
num
={num,num}
here is the synthsized netlist is:
