# Week 1: Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

### **Objective**

This week focuses on the fundamentals of Verilog for RTL design, covering key concepts from basic combinational and sequential logic to efficient coding practices and initial synthesis flows. The goal is to establish a strong foundation for the physical design phase.

### **Pre-requisites**

A successful completion of the **[Week 0: Tool Setup](./RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout-Program/Week_0/README.md)** task is required for this week's labs. This ensures you have the necessary environment and tools ready to begin. The following tools should be installed and verified in your Linux/WSL environment:
* **Yosys** (for synthesis)
* **Iverilog** (for RTL simulation)
* **GTKWave** (for waveform viewing)
