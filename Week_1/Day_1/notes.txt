1.Introduction to iverilog,desidn and test bench

    Simulator
        - Simulator is the tool used for simulating the design.
        - RTL design is checked for adherence to the spec by simmulating the design.
         -here we uesd the iverilog.
    Design
      - DEsign is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which has the intended                   functionality to meet with required specifications.
    Testbench
       -TestBench is the setup to apply stimulus(test_vectors)to the design to check its functionality.

How simulator works?
 - simulator looks for the changes on the input signals.
 -Upon change to the input the output is evaluated.
   if no change to the input,no change to the output.
-Simulator is looking for the change in the values of input.
-Design may have 1 or more primary inputs ,1 or more primary outputs.
-TB doesn't have a primary input or primary output...

Iverilog based Simulation Flow:
  -Design and testbench is appilied to iverilog simulator...
  -simulator looks for change in input and ots output is dumped into vcd file called Value Change Dump and to  view output in waveform  we used the gtkwave tool

----
  in VSD folder , make directory called VLSI and install the VSD flow and git clone  "https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop"
 'bash 
 sudo -i
 cd /home/vsd/vlsi
 git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
after clone you will see,
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
ls
cd my_lib contains all our library files 
cd lib 
ls contains the stardend cell library which is uesd for our synthesis...
cd ..
cd verilog_models ths contains all stardand cell verilog models
cd ..
cd ..
cd verilog_files which contains our lab expt contains verilog sources file and its testbench
