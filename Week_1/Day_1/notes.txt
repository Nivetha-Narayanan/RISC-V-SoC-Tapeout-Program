1.Introduction to iverilog,desidn and test bench

    Simulator
        - Simulator is the tool used for simulating the design.
        - RTL design is checked for adherence to the spec by simmulating the design.
         -here we uesd the iverilog.
    Design
      - DEsign is the actual verilog code or set of verilog codes which has the intended                   functionality to meet with required specifications.
    Testbench
       -TestBench is the setup to apply stimulus(test_vectors)to the design to check its functionality.

How simulator works?
 - simulator looks for the changes on the input signals.
 -Upon change to the input the output is evaluated.
   if no change to the input,no change to the output.
-Simulator is looking for the change in the values of input.
-Design may have 1 or more primary inputs ,1 or more primary outputs.
-TB doesn't have a primary input or primary output...

Iverilog based Simulation Flow:
  -Design and testbench is appilied to iverilog simulator...
  -simulator looks for change in input and ots output is dumped into vcd file called Value Change Dump and to  view output in waveform  we used the gtkwave tool

----
  in VSD folder , make directory called VLSI and install the VSD flow and git clone  "https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop"
 'bash 
 sudo -i
 cd /home/vsd/vlsi
 git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
after clone you will see,
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
ls
cd my_lib contains all our library files 
cd lib 
ls contains the stardend cell library which is uesd for our synthesis...
cd ..
cd verilog_models ths contains all stardand cell verilog models
cd ..
cd ..
cd verilog_files which contains our lab expt contains verilog sources file and its testbench
iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
ls
we able to see a.out file
./a.out
then we see the dumped vcd file named as  tb_good_mux.vcd 
gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd 
we see output as a waveform using the gtkwave tool..

Synthesizer 
  -tool used for  converting the  RTL to netlist
 - in this course ,we used the yosys as a synthesizer
Design and .lib given to the yosys tool ,it gives netlist file..
yosys Setup
  -read_verilog command used to read the verilog design 
  -read_liberty command used to read .lib
  -write_verilog command to writeout the netlist...
 -Netlist is the represention of design in form of standard cell present in .lib...

Verify the synthesis
  -netlist and testbench (same as used in stimulator) is applied to iverilog and it gives the vcd file and then vcd file is viewws as waveform using gtkwave tool.
Note: the primary input and output is same for both RTL design and synthesized netlist.(Smae testbench is used).

Synthesis
  -RTL Design:Behavioural representation of required specification(In VHDL)..
  -how to map a RTL VHDL code into Digital Logic Circuit?
     RTL into Gate level translation.the design is coverted into gate and connections are made between the gates .This is givenout as file as "Netlist"
What is .lib?
   -collection of logical modules (includeing basic logic gates AND,OR,NOT etc,. )
    -different flavors of same gate(2 i/p, 3i/p and each gate delay vary )
Why we need a diiferent flavors of same gate?
  -Combinational delay in logic path determines the max speed of operation od digital logic circuit.
`  -We need a faster cell to meet the required performance and as we need cell that works slow to meet "HOLD" ..it truly depends on cicuit design.
